# Incrementing Digits Tool

The Incrementing Digits Tool is a simple program designed to increment the digits of any given integer by 1. If a digit
is 9, it is incremented to 0. The resulting integer is then output in groups of 4 digits for easy readability.

In result, these numbers are divisible by 4.

# Example Output

```
    1234 5678
    
    2345 6789 
```

# Explanation

In the above example, the user is prompted to enter a series of numbers. Each number is then incremented by 1 in each
digit, resulting in the output shown above. If the user enters a blank line, the program stops taking input and outputs
the incremented numbers.
# Notes
This tool is written in Java and can be compiled and run using a Java compiler and runtime environment.
